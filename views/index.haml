    autobuild allows you to easily set up a 
    %b Web Service Hook 
    in your 
    %b Git 
    repository that will automatically pull the updated code from your last commit and start building the application.

    How does it work?
  %p
    It's very simple. You will need:
    %ul
      %li 
        Your PhoneGap Build 
        %b username 
        (typically your email address)
      %li 
        Your PhoneGap Build 
        %b password
      %li 
        The 
        %b App ID 
        for the application you are working on
  %p
    The account details are used to perform an HTTP Basic Authentication into the PhoneGap Build control panel to perform the pull request. Don't worry, we 
    %b
      do not
    store these details anywhere.
    
  %p
    The URL you provide as the Web Hook must match the following format:
    %br 
      http://autobuild.monkeh.me/
      %b username
      &#47;
      %b password
      &#47;
      %b appid
      
  %p
    That's it! Save that URL as the hook, and every commit you make to your Git repository will automatically update the code and rebuild the application for you.
